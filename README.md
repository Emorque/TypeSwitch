## Setup
##### TypeScript requires an experimental flag from Chrome 131+ on desktop platforms
##### It is recommended to use with [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/) or [Chrome Dev](https://www.google.com/chrome/dev/?extra=devchannel) 
#### 
1. Visit the [website]()
2. Sign up for the [Early Preview Program](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZXeiwj9KO9jMctffHPym88ln12xNWCrVkMY_u06WfSTulQg/viewform)
3. Enable the necessary flag
4. That's It!


## How to Use

- Copy & Paste a piece of text (Can be from an article, book, blog, etc.)
- Select your base and target language
    - As of (12.3.24), only English-Spanish and English-Japanese is supported   
- Try your best to translate the original sentence to your selected target language
- Once all sentences are translated, you will see a page of translations from you and Translation API
- A general score is given to give a estimate of how you did, Grammar/syntax is not fully accounted for, so don't take the score to heart
- Compare your translations to that of Translation API and see how you did. 

## Want to Use TypeScript Locally?
1. Have the neccessary flag enabled in your Chrome of choice
2. Ensure your translation pairs are downloaded to your browser
3. Clone this repo to your local machine
4. Run the html on the same Chrome browser you have the flag enabled in
5. Viola!

## Features to work on in the future: 
1. Create a backend to house user data and authentication. 
2. Create a complementary extension.  
3. Have a daily sentence! Kind of like how Wordle has a daily word people try to guess. 
4. Improve the UI/UX.
